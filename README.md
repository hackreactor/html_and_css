# Hack Reactor: HTML and CSS Workshop

It's time to build a website! Leverage the knowledge you gained during the workshop lectures to make your own site. If you know how to create html and css files on your computer and use a text editor to write code, go ahead and get a site going that way. If not, follow these steps to create an environment where you can start writing code:

1. Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it)
2. Click on the 'new repl' button
3. Select 'HTML, CSS, JS' from the dropdown menu

This will create an environment with three files: an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. They are are linked together through the HTML file, so you can jump right into writing code and creating your website! 

- Write your HTML code in the `index.html` file
- Write your CSS code in the `style.css` file.
